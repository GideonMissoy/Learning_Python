This directory is meant to explore and improve understanding on functions, modules and storing functions in modules.
- Storing functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of your program's code and focus on its higher-level coding
- It also allows you to reuse functions in many different programs.
- Knowing how to import functions allows you to use libraries of functions that other programmers have written.
